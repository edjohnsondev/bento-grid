## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS (with mixins, variables, and partials)

### What I learned

This project gave me a better understanding of how to effectively use CSS Grid to create dynamic, responsive layouts. I focused on getting the spacing and alignment right to reflect a true bento-style layout. It was also a great reminder of how powerful CSS Grid is when it comes to building modern UIs without needing extra markup or wrapper elements.

I spent time figuring out how to structure my SCSS with reusable mixins and variables to make the layout easier to scale and maintain. I experimented with creating mixins for responsive grid behavior and spacing, which made adjusting layouts across breakpoints much quicker. It also helped clarify what kind of mixins are worth abstracting versus what’s better left inline for flexibility.

### Continued development

In future iterations, I’d like to add subtle hover interactions and animations to make the grid feel more interactive. I’m also considering implementing theme switching (light/dark) and maybe pulling content from an API to make the grid more dynamic.

Potentially animate the graphics inside each card.

### Useful resources
